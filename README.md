Cruor's Cheaty Computers
========================

A mod made for Cruor because he is too lazy to do crafting in a game that has got "craft" in its name. Allows spawning in fully assembled OpenComputers setups.

I wouldn't use it, you shouldn't use it. Please play OC like it's supposed to be played.

## Download

Not sure if I want to provide one since this mod shouldn't be used. If you are desperate enough, compile it for yourself for now, I guess.

##Misc

I have no idea why I made this mod. It's horrible. But hey, Cruor can stop complaining now.
